##Raccoons and Pumas, BFFAE
 
####Step 1: 
Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxiSP_ch_oI)

###Step 2: 
We're going to build two classes. A Raccoon class and a Puma class. 

####Your Raccoon class:
1 Should have 4 attributes: name, age, has_puma_bff, and puma_points. You can decide which data types each attribute should be.

2 Should be able to initialize a new instance of the Raccoon class with both a name and an age.

3 Every instance of the Raccoon class should automatically have a puma bff. You'll need to set the value has_puma_bff during initialization.

4 Raccoons aren't born with puma_points. They have to be given to them by their puma best friend. You'll need to set that value to zero.

5 Each instance of your Raccoon class should be able to talk to it's puma bff. You'll want to build a method that allows each raccoon to tell it's best friend "I LOVE YOU PUMA BEST FRIEND". 

6 Raccoons need to be able to give raccoon_points to their puma bff. You'll need to create a method called `give_raccoon_points`. This method should accept any argument (the instance of the puma class to give the points to) and should increment the raccoon_points attribute of the instance of the Puma class.

####Your Puma Class:
1 Should have 4 attributes: name, age, has_raccoon_bff, and raccoon_points. You can decide which data types each attribute should be.

2 Should be able to initialize a new instance of the Puma class with both a name and an age.

3 Every instance of the Puma class should automatically have a raccoon bff. You'll need to set the value has_raccoon_bff during initialization.

4 Pumas aren't born with raccoon_points. They have to be given to them by their raccoon best friend. You'll need to set that value to zero.

5 Each instance of your Puma class should be able to talk to it's puma bff. You'll want to build a method that allows each raccoon to tell it's best friend "I LOVE YOU RACCOON BEST FRIEND". 

6 Pumas need to be able to give puma_points to their puma bff. You'll need to create a method called `give_puma_points`. This method should accept any argument (the instance of the puma class to give the points to) and should increment the puma_points attribute of the instance of the Raccoon class.

7 Finally, Pumas need to be able to drop their best friend, and get another. You'll need to create a method called `drop_raccoon_bestie`. This method should accept an instance of the Raccoon class as an argument. The body of the method should set the has_puma_bff attribute of the Raccoon class to false.
